Just a simple voucher generator for the pyfmi course.
I really hate when Stefan(skanev) calls me less than hour before a lecture with "Make me some vouchers and don't be late!".

So I decided to write some simple python script. If I wrote something usable(it's almost 03:00 out here and I'm basically...well...out of order) will copy it to the pyfmi repo.

TODO: Make more descriptive output for main.py file and all this needs refactoring
